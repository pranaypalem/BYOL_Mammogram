## 🏗️ Enhanced Architecture

```
Input Mammogram → Enhanced Segmentation → Frequency Analysis → 512×512 Tile Extraction
                                                                      ↓

                                                                      ↓
ImageNet ResNet50 → Projection Head (2048→4096→256) → Prediction Head → BYOL Loss
       ↓                                                              
Classification Head (2048→2048→2) [mass, calcification]
```

### Key Improvements:
- **Larger Tiles**: 512×512 for better context (4x larger)
- **Enhanced Augmentations**: View1 (±15° rotation, 0.3 brightness/contrast) + View2 (±25° rotation, 0.4 brightness/contrast, perspective, blur)
- **Dual Selection**: Breast tissue ratio + frequency energy for micro-calcifications
- **A100 Optimized**: Mixed precision, large batch (32), scaled LR (2e-3)

## 🔧 Enhanced Configuration

Key parameters in `train_byol_mammo.py`:

### Tile Processing:
- `TILE_SIZE = 512`: Larger tiles for better context (increased from 256)
- `TILE_STRIDE = 256`: 50% overlap for comprehensive coverage
- `MIN_BREAST_RATIO = 0.15`: Minimum breast tissue per tile (more permissive)
- `MIN_FREQ_ENERGY = 0.03`: Micro-calcification detection threshold
- `MIN_TILE_INTENSITY = 40`: Background rejection threshold
- `MIN_NON_ZERO_PIXELS = 0.7`: Empty space rejection (70% meaningful pixels)

### Training Optimization:
- `BATCH_SIZE = 32`: A100-optimized batch size
- `NUM_WORKERS = 16`: Maximum CPU utilization  
- `LR = 2e-3`: Scaled learning rate with 10-epoch warmup
- `EPOCHS = 100`: Full training cycle
- `MOMENTUM_BASE = 0.996`: Per-step momentum updates

### BYOL Augmentations:
- **View 1**: ±15° rotation, 0.3 brightness/contrast, scale 0.85-1.15
- **View 2**: ±25° rotation, 0.4 brightness/contrast, perspective, blur, grayscale

## 🎯 Usage for Classification

After BYOL pre-training, use the model for classification:

```python
# Load pre-trained BYOL model
model = MammogramBYOL(backbone, INPUT_DIM, HIDDEN_DIM, PROJ_DIM)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('mammogram_byol_best.pth')['model_state_dict'])

# Extract features or classify
features = model.get_features(image_tensor)
predictions = model.classify(image_tensor)
```

## 📈 Enhanced Monitoring

Training metrics tracked:
- **BYOL Loss**: Negative cosine similarity (should converge more slowly with stronger augmentations)
- **Learning Rate**: Warmup + cosine annealing schedule
- **Breast Tissue Ratio**: Average per batch for quality monitoring
- **Momentum Schedule**: Per-step updates for optimal BYOL training
- **GPU Utilization**: A100 memory and compute efficiency
- **Training Speed**: Batches per second and time remaining
- **Model Checkpoints**: Best, periodic (every 10 epochs), and final models

### Expected Training Dynamics:
- **Early epochs**: Higher loss variability (good - indicates strong augmentations)
- **Mid training**: Gradual convergence without plateau
- **Final epochs**: Stable convergence around loss -0.95 to -0.99

## 🖥️ Research Computing Deployment

1. **Clone repository** on your HPC system
2. **Install dependencies** with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Prepare dataset** with your specific paths using `prepare_dataset.py`
4. **Configure GPU**: Optimized for A100 GPUs (adjust batch size for smaller GPUs)
5. **Run training**: `python train_byol_mammo.py` or submit via SLURM

### Performance Expectations:
- **A100-80GB**: 4-5 hours for 100 epochs (optimal configuration)
